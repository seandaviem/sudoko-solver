# sudoko-solver
My wife and I started playing sudokus together. This seemed like a fun way to practice with languages I like, but don't get to use often, like C#.

## Approach
To start, I'm going to work on implementing a brute-force backtracking alogorithm to solve simple puzzles. Then we'll see where we go from there.
